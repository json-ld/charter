        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Since it&quot; original publication in 2014, JSON-LD has become an essential
          format for describing structured data on the World Wide Web. Thanks, in part,
          to adoption by schema.org as a recommended format, its use on the Web
          has grown enormously, used by between 10% to 18.2% of all websites.</p>
          <dl>
            <dt><a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2017-12/stats/stats.html">Web Data Commons publication in November 2017</a></dt>
            <dd>Of 26,271,491 domains crawled, 2,685,738 contained embedded JSON-LD.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld/all/all">W3Techs reports in January 2018</a></dt>
            <dd>8.2% of all websites use JSON-LD.</dd>
          </dl>

        <p>In the time between original publication by the RDF 1.1 Working Group and now
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a>
          has had over 100 participants and over
          <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E2014-01-01+-label%3Awebsite+-label%3Aplayground+">100 issues filed</a>.
          In response, the CG has worked to update the specifications and test-suite, accepting
          over <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+created%3A%3E2014-01-01">90 pull requests</a> for a pending CG 1.1 release.
          This issues generally relate to allowing more natural JSON idioms to be expressed using JSON-LD:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow contexts to be defined within term definitions (Scoped Contexts) that apply for values of that term (<a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/445">PR 445</a>)</li>
          <li>Index values based on <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> (<a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/449">PR 449</a>).</li>
          <li>Allow for deeper nesting of properties and values without introducing semantics (<a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/451">PR 451</a>).</li>
          <li>Require <code>@version</code> announcement to enable new features (<a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/473">PR 473</a>).</li>
          <li>Improve <code>@container</code> description to ensure values always take an array form (<a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/503">PR 503</a>).</li>
          <li>Allow named graphs to be supported as values without the use of the <code>@graph</code> keyword (<a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/549">PR 549</a>).</li>
          <li>Allow all values to be used in a map, through the use of a transparent <code>@none</code> index (<a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/569">PR 569</a> – pending).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, changes have been made to align with updated dependent specifications and
          to separate the JSON-specific syntax to a more abstract representation compatible
          with binary and other forms closely related to JSON (e.g., <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049">CBOR</a> and <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML</a>, see <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/pull/485">PR 485</a>).</p>

        <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">JSON-LD Working Group</a> is to improve the specifications
          and address specific issues addressing affected communities, such as Web of Things,
          publishing and other emerging JSON-LD adopters.</p>

          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p>The group will maintain and advance the <a href="https://json-ld.org/test-suite/">Test Suite</a> allowing for continued
            testing of JSON-LD 1.0 implementations in addition to JSON-LD processors
            operating both in legacy and 2.0 modes.</p>

          <p>
            The JSON-LD Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="syntax" class="spec">JSON-LD 2.0: A JSON-based Serialization for Linked Data</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This specification defines JSON-LD,
                a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is
                designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already
                use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to
                JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked
                Data in Web-based programming environments, to build
                interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in
                JSON-based storage engines.</p>

              <p>This specification defines a set of algorithms for programmatic transformations
                of JSON-LD documents. Restructuring data according to the
                defined transformations often dramatically simplifies its
                usage. Furthermore, this document proposes an Application
                Programming Interface (API) for developers implementing the
                specified algorithms.</p>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review after FPWD and before CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response from the horizontal group. This compromise offers early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">JSON-LD Working Group home page.</a>

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

          Patent Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This Working Group operates under the <a href="https://w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (5 February 2004 Version). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.

          For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a shape="rect" href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
            Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
