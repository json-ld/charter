          <h1>Draft</h1>

          <p>
            This is the charter for a JSON-LD Working Group. The canonical version is at <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/03/jsonld-wg-charter.html">the W3C Website</a>, though the content is identical to this version.
          </p>

      <h1 id="title">JSON-LD Working Group Charter</h1>

        <p>Since its original publication in 2014 by the RDF 1.1 Working Group,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/">JSON-LD 1.0</a> has become an essential
          format for describing structured data on the World Wide Web. It is estimated to be used by between 10% and 18.2% of all websites. This is due largely to its adoption as a recommended format by
          <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>. It has been adopted by several Recommendations including those from the Social Web, Web Annotation, and Linked Data Platform Working Groups, and current Working Groups have expressed interest in alignment of their specifications, such as the Publishing and Web of Things Working Groups. It has provided a much-needed bridge between communities that need rich semantics, and those that desire an intuitive and easily usable format (see separate <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/wiki/Changes-in-Community-Group-Drafts-Targeted-for-1.1">wiki page</a> for more details).</p>

        <p>Subsequently the specifications have been discussed within, and errata have been maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a>. New <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E2014-01-01+-label%3Awebsite+-label%3Aplayground+">issues have been raised</a>, primarily around allowing JSON-LD to be expressed using more natural JSON idioms. </p>

      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/">JSON-LD Working Group</a> is to update the JSON-LD 1.0 specifications to address specific usability or technical issues based on the community's experiences, implementer feedback, and requests for new features.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/">JSON-LD Working Group</a> will update the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/">JSON-LD 1.0 Recommendation</a> to take into account new features and desired simplifications that have become apparent since its publication. The group will also extend the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-api-20140116/">JSON-LD 1.0 Processing Algorithms and API Recommendation</a> to update the existing APIs corresponding to changes in the JSON-LD Recommendation. Additionally, the group will move the <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-framing/">Framing API</a> CG specification to W3C Recommendation.</p>

        <p>A summary of syntax changes proposed for inclusion by the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/">JSON for Linking Data Community Group</a>
          can be found on a <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/wiki/Changes-in-Community-Group-Drafts-Targeted-for-1.1">wiki</a>
          and in <a href="https://json-ld.org/presentations/JSON-LD-Update-TPAC-2017/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0">slides used at TPAC 2017</a>.</p>

        <p>The work must be consistent with principles expressed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices</a> Recommendation. All changes must preserve backward compatibility for JSON-LD 1.0 documents. This means that, when processing existing JSON-LD documents, JSON-LD 1.1 processors generate the same expanded output, unless that output is subject to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/JSON_LD_Errata">errata in JSON-LD 1.0</a> or is otherwise an unspecified implementation detail.</p>

          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p>The group will maintain and advance the <a href="https://json-ld.org/test-suite/">Test Suite</a> allowing for continued testing of JSON-LD 1.0 implementations in addition to JSON-LD processors
          operating both in 1.0 and 1.1 modes.</p>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The JSON-LD Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="syntax" class="spec">JSON-LD 1.1</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                This specification defines JSON-LD 1.1, a JSON-based format to serialize RDF&nbsp;1.1 Graphs and Datasets as used for Linked Data and in Web content.
                The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD, with as little additional cost as possible.

                JSON-LD 1.1 will extend the current <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/">JSON-LD 1.0 Recommendation</a> while ensuring backwards compatibility.
              </p>

              <p>The Working Group will handle all the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/JSON_LD_Errata">errata filed for JSON-LD 1.0.</a></p>

              <p>
                  Finally, the documents will better align the JSON-LD and RDF terminologies wherever applicable and without jeopardizing backward compatibility with deployed JSON-LD 1.0 data. Detailed comparisons with other RDF serialization formats will also be included.

                This specification defines a set of algorithms for programmatic transformations of JSON-LD 1.1 documents.
                JSON-LD 1.1 API will extend the current <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-api-20140116/">JSON-LD 1.0 API Recommendation</a>.
                The Working Group will also consider incorporating the widely used <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-framing/">Framing</a> specification into JSON-LD 1.1 API, rather than as a separate deliverable.
              </p>

              <p>The Working Group will handle all the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/JSON_LD_Errata">errata filed for JSON-LD 1.0 API.</a></p>

                This specification defines an extension to <a href="#api">JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API</a>
                that allows developers to query by example and force a specific tree layout to a JSON-LD document.

          </dl>

          <p>
            The Working Group will also address the security, privacy, and efficiency issues (e.g., preventing the needs for unnecessary dereferencing) raised by handling @context files in the current JSON-LD 1.0 version, for example by providing ways to indicate the use of common syntactic profiles so that context-fetching can be avoided. These issues (and also some editorial considerations) may affect the HTTP protocol related sections, and the WG may decide to extract those issues into a separate Recommendation and/or Working Group Note.
          </p>

          <p>The comparison sections on RDF serializations and related toolchains such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">SHACL</a>, <a href="http://shex.io/">Shex</a>, and <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, may also be published as a separate Working Group Note rather than (non-normative) sections of the respective Recommendation.</p>

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
